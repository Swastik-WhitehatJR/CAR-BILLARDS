# CAR-BILLARDS
This is a pool game played on a billiards table in which you use cars to strike all striped balls into the pockets around the edge of the table before the computer strikes all the solid balls. You have to use the arrow keys to drive the car and use the spacebar to boost. Avoid hitting the 8 Ball or your car will be disabled for 8 seconds. There are three types of modes you can play in like normal mode, shake mode and the effectless mode. You can also choose your car colour, your name, the enemy's name (also you can use the defaults). Also there are some cool sound effects. This was created in Javascript using the help of P5.js and Matter.js libraries and also from my WhitehatJR Classes, Youtube, Github repositories, Stack Overflow, Stack Exchange, etc. This is also a project of the Class 48 in WhitehatJR Pro Course. To edit the game change the code in the sketch.js file.
